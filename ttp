Initial Access:

Spear Phishing: The group uses targeted phishing emails with malicious attachments or links to deliver their malware.
Exploits: APT41 has been known to use both zero-day and known vulnerabilities to gain initial access to target systems. For instance, they exploited vulnerabilities in Cisco routers and Citrix devices.
Execution:

Scripting: The group uses scripts such as PowerShell, JavaScript, and VBScript to execute commands, move laterally, or deploy payloads.
Persistence:

Scheduled Tasks: APT41 sets tasks to maintain persistence on the infected host.
Service Manipulation: They modify or create Windows services to ensure their tools or malware persist across reboots.
Privilege Escalation:

Exploitation of Vulnerabilities: They exploit system vulnerabilities to gain higher privileges on compromised systems.
Defense Evasion:

Deobfuscation: APT41 uses custom deobfuscation routines for their payloads.
Process Injection: They inject malicious code into legitimate processes to hide their activities.
Masquerading: They name their files and processes to resemble legitimate ones, making detection harder.
Credential Access:

Dumping Credentials: The group employs tools like Mimikatz to harvest credentials from memory.
Discovery:

They employ various methods to discover accounts, processes, or services running on compromised systems.
Lateral Movement:

Remote Services: APT41 uses remote services like RDP to move across networks.
Valid Accounts: Leveraging stolen credentials, they access other machines in the network.
Collection:

They gather data from various directories, take screenshots, and also steal database contents.
Exfiltration:

Encrypted Channels: Data is often exfiltrated over encrypted channels to evade detection.
Command and Control (C2):
Multiple Protocols: APT41 has been observed using DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS for C2 communications.
Dynamic DNS: They use dynamic DNS services to manage their C2 infrastructure.
Malware & Tools:
APT41 uses a range of custom tools and malware families, including WINNTI, BARIUM, and others. They have a varied arsenal that aids in multiple stages of attack.
